#### GOALS ####

To get 50 gold stars and save Christmas.

#### STEPS ####

1. Clone the repo using the links at the bottom of this README ie "git clone git@github.com:wiz0rd/advent_of_code_2021.git"

2. Capture the challenge input from https://adventofcode.com and paste it into the input.txt file for the
corresponding challenge.

3. Write your coding solution to the challenge using any method / file system you want.

4. Post your solution, which should just be a number usually, in the solution.txt file.

5. Run "git add *" to add your new code to the repo and save your work.

6. Run "git commit" to commit your work when you are ready.

7. Run "git push" to push your work to the repository.

8. Log in to https://adventofcode.com to test if your answer is the correct solution to the problem

9. If you have solved the problem change your "challenge1" or "challenge2" directory to "challenge1_solved"
or "challenge2_solved".

#### FUTURE ####

I will be creating an email account we will all have to share. Or, I can handle the submissions for our team 
account, and people can use personal advent of code accounts to test their code. We can take a vote on this
once everyone joins the slack channel. Either way is fine by me, once the answer is made available it would
only take me a few minutes per day to answer the challenge.
