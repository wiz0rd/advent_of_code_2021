						#### GOALS ####

To get 50 gold stars and save Christmas
Have FUN!
Don't Stress! We may not solve all of these!
Learn to collaborate in DEVOPS with GIT and Slack!

#### STEPS ####

1. Clone the repo using the links at the bottom of this README ie "git clone git@github.com:wiz0rd/advent_of_code_2021.git"
2. ALWAYS work in a BRANCH (Use Github logic section below if you have not done this before)
3. There are two challenges each day, but the input is the same. Capture the input and paste it into the challenge1 and challenge2 folder
"input.txt" file.
4. Code your solution to the problem using whatever language you want.
5. Test your solution at adventofcode.com
6. Update the solution.txt file in the challenge1 and challenge2 directory with the solution (Usually a number like 1483) that is the
only thing that belongs in solution.txt file.
7. After both challenge1 and challenge2 are successfully solved for two gold stars, append "_solved" to the main directory name. 
EX: "12_01_CHRIS_solved"

#### Github Logic ####
a. git clone git@github.com:wiz0rd/advent_of_code_2021.git #Clones the repo to your local directory structure
b. git branch -a #Shows available branches to checkout
c. git branch <new branch> #Creates a new branch
d. git checkout <branch name> #Checks out an existing branch to the user
e. git checkout -b <new branch name> #Creates a new branch and immediately checks out the branch
f. git add * #Adds new files and folders to the current branch
g. git commit #Commits the work for saving to github
h. git checkout master #Changes back to the master branch
i. git branch -a #Verifies what branch is currently checked out (denoted by *)
j. git merge <branch name> --no-ff #Merges whichever branch to the master branch
k. git push #Pushes all the changes up to github

#### Submitting Solutions ####

1. Each group member will have their own Advent of Code account. 

2. Accounts can be created easily by linking an account: 

"To play, please identify yourself via one of these services:

[GitHub] [Google] [Twitter] [Reddit] - [How Does Auth Work?]"

3. Once your account is linked, access to the puzzles will be available to you.

4. Many of the players might not want to "cheat" to get their stars, feel free not to use the solutions provided by
the group if you don't want to. If you have time you are encouraged to solve as many puzzles on your own as you 
would like.
