###Advent of Code Collaboration 2021###

If you are unfamiliar with Advent of Code, basically, it is an event that has been running since 2015. Two coding
challenges are made available at Midnight each day from December 1st to December 25th. For each successful challenge
completed, competitors are awarded a gold star. If we get 50 gold stars, we can "Save Christmas".

The challenges, at least last year, and I expect this to continue, are made available in the form of a very long
string (thousands or tens of thousands of characters) that can be accessed via the web. The best method to capture
this string that I have found is with Copy and Paste. However, beware of translator software in your browser! Last
year my translator software was minutely modifying the output so I would always fail a challenge, even though I
felt like my code was good!

Anyways, the first step is always to capture the output, and save it into the github repo on the input.txt file
which will be located in the directory like this:
12_01_TOMAS/challenge1/input.txt

or

12_01_TOMAS/challenge2/input.txt

Once you have captured the input, and saved it and updated the repo, then you can go on to solve the puzzle. Once
the puzzle is completed and solved correctly, change the name of the directory like this:

12_01_TOMAS_COMPLETE

#### FUTURE ####

I will be creating an email account we will all have to share. Or, I can handle the submissions for our team 
account, and people can use personal advent of code accounts to test their code. We can take a vote on this
once everyone joins the slack channel. Either way is fine by me, once the answer is made available it would
only take me a few minutes per day to answer the challenge.
