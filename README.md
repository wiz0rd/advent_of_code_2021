#### Submitting Solutions ####

1. Each group member will have their own Advent of Code account. 

2. Accounts can be created easily by linking an account: 

"To play, please identify yourself via one of these services:

[GitHub] [Google] [Twitter] [Reddit] - [How Does Auth Work?]"

3. Once your account is linked, access to the puzzles will be available to you.

4. Many of the players might not want to "cheat" to get their stars, feel free not to use the solutions provided by
the group if you don't want to. If you have time you are encouraged to solve as many puzzles on your own as you 
would like.
