#### WARNING ####
Always use BRANCH git functionality when you code. Check out a Branch or we could lose the whole repo!

#### GOALS ####

To get 50 gold stars and save Christmas.

#### STEPS ####

1. Clone the repo using the links at the bottom of this README ie "git clone git@github.com:wiz0rd/advent_of_code_2021.git"

2. Change directory into the new advent_of_code_2021 directory and run the command "git branch -a" to view existing
branches and to see which branch you are currently on. (Denoted by *)

3. If you don't already have a branch you are working on , create a new branch with "git branch <new branch>"
or "git checkout -b <new branch name>" to create the new branch and immediately move into it. If you have already
created a branch and you are coming back to it to continue your work, the command is,  "git checkout <branch name>". 

4. Only work in directories that are assigned to you in the batting order.(folders with your name)

5. Capture the challenge input from https://adventofcode.com and paste it into the input.txt file for the
corresponding challenge in your days folder challenge1 or challenge2, input.txt file that already exists
inside your directory structure for your day. The challenge input stays the same for both challenges.

5. Write your coding solution to the challenge using any coding language or system you want and save it however
you like. I recommend something like "day1_challenge1.py" inside the challenge1 folder.

6. Once you have some working code, and you think you have solved it, test your solution (usually a number value)
at adventofcode.com and see if you are rewarded a gold star. If you do get a gold star, post your solution in the
"solution.txt" in the "/advent_of_code/YOUR_DAY/challenge1/solution.txt" file. (I've only seen this be a numerical
value.) 

7. Once you have a working solution to both challenge1 and challenge2 for your day, append the directory name for
that day with "solved" so everyone knows that day is done. EX: "12_01_CHRIS" becomes "12_01_CHRIS_solved"

8. The branch is now ready to be merged with the Master. Run the following commands: "git add *", "git commit",
"git checkout master", "git branch" (to confirm you are now in the master branch), "git merge <branch name> --no-ff",
and finally, "git push".

9. Relax, It's Miller Time.

#### Submitting Solutions ####

1. Each group member will have their own Advent of Code account. 

2. Accounts can be created easily by linking an account: 

"To play, please identify yourself via one of these services:

[GitHub] [Google] [Twitter] [Reddit] - [How Does Auth Work?]"

3. Once your account is linked, access to the puzzles will be available to you.

4. Many of the players might not want to "cheat" to get their stars, feel free not to use the solutions provided by
the group if you don't want to. If you have time you are encouraged to solve as many puzzles on your own as you 
would like.

#### Rules of Thumb ####
1. This is for fun and learning, if you can't solve a challenge on your own, ask for help! We will try to help, and
some of these are REALLY hard, even together we might not solve a few of these! So if we don't come through and solve
them all, that's definitely OK too, and no shame to anyone who didn't complete a challenge!

2. Lets learn to work in a collaborative environment using Slack and Git Branches and do some coding as well, and
again, above all HAVE FUN!
